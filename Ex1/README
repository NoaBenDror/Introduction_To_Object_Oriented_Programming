Book.java - This class represents a book, which has a title, author, year of publication and
             different literary aspects.
Patron.java - This class represents a library patron that has a name and assigns values to
              different literary aspects of books.
Library.java - This class represents a library, which holds a collection of books. Patrons can
               register at the library to be able to check out books, if a copy of the requested
               book is available.

=============================
Library class is in charge of storing books IDs and patron IDs (a book object doesn't know its ID,
a patron object doesn't know its ID). A patron object doesn't know which book he's borrowing (but a book
object does know who is its borrower).

I did not use access modifiers.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Library class, in order to store the books IDs and patrons IDs i used arrays,
and the books placement (index) in the array is actually it's ID number.
I used lastBookId and lastPatronId which actually represent the last index in the array which isn't null.
In that way, when checking all the books/patrons, we can traverse only up to lastBookId/lastPatronId.
